        The first true laptop to make it to market, the Osborne 1, hit shelves in April 1981. Created by
         Adam Osborne, the computer featured a 12.7-centimetre (5-inch) screen and weighed 11.1 kilograms
          (24.5 pounds). However, the machine still required an 
        AC outlet for poweradvantage of a portable computer is its mobility.

        The Portal was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies and developments department 
        of the French firm R2E Micral in <b>1980 at the request of the company CCMC specializing in payroll and 
            accounting. It was based on an Intel 8085 processor, </b>8-bit, clocked at 2 MHz. It was equipped with a 
        central 64K byte RAM, a keyboard with 58 alphanumeric keys and 11 numeric keys (in separate blocks), 
        a 32-character screen, a floppy disk (capacity - 140,000 characters), a thermal printer (speed - 28 
        characters/second), an asynchronous channel, a synchronous channel, and a 220-volt power supply. 
        Designed for an operating temperature of 15 35 Â°C, it weighed 12 kg (26 lb) and its dimensions were 
        45  45  15 cm. It ran the Prologue operating system[2] and provided total mobility.<br>

        The Compaq Portable was the first PC-compatible portable computer created in 1982. 
        The first shipment was in March 1983 and was priced at US$2,995 (equivalent to $9,456 in 2023).
         The Compaq Portable folded up<del>into a luggable case the size of a portable sewing machine, 
            similar in size to the Osborne</del>  1. The third model of this development, Compaq Portable II, 
         featured high resolution graphics on its tube display. It was the first portable computer 
         ready to be used on the shop floor, and for CAD and diagram display. It established Compaq 
         as a major brand on the market.<br>

        Two other noteworthy early laptops were the Sharp PC-5000 (similar in many respects to the Dulmont Magnum)
         and the Gavilan SC, announced in 1983 but first sold in 1984, Gavilan filing bankruptcy the same year.
          Both ran the 8/16-bit Intel 8088 CPU. The Gavilan was notably the first computer to be marketed as a 
          "laptop". It was equipped<u>with an internal floppy disk drive and a pioneering touchpad-like pointing
            device, installed on a panel above the keyboard. Like the GRiD Compass, the Gavilan and the Sharp were
             housed in clamshell cases, but they were partly IBM-compatible,</u>  although primarily running their own 
            system software. Both had LCDs, and could connect to optional external printers.<br>
