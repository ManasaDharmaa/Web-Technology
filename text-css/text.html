    <h1>Dog</h1>

    <p id="good-day">The dog is a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication
         (i.e. dogs neither benefited nor got harmed).[18][24] The questions of when and where dogs
          were first domesticated remains uncertain.[19] Genetic studies suggest a domestication process
           commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high
            Arctic, or eastern Asia.[25] In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that 
            the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later 
            dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia,[16] with dogs likely accompanying
             the first humans to inhabit the Americas.[16] Some studies have suggested that the extinct Japanese
              wolf is closely related to the ancestor of domestic dogs.</p>

              <h2>Cat</h2>

              <p id="sun-shine">The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor
                 about 10 to 15 million years ago.[26] The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae 
                 began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago.[27] 
                 Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 
                 6.46 to 16.76 million years ago.[28] The genus Felis genetically diverged from other 
                 Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago.[27] Results of phylogenetic research shows that 
                 the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas
                  the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[29] The domestic cat and its closest
                   wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes[30] and roughly 20,000 genes</p>

            <p id="school">The tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept
                in captivity since ancient times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other 
                entertainment shows. The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore 
                of cultures throughout its historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide.</p>
